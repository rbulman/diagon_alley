** NOTES: Things to Investiage **

- user.js line 39  Promise.resolve(user) --> what does this do? 
	- in what case would !user.password be true (line 39)

- db/index.js line 26: require not save as variable. how is sync function using the info from models folder?

- how can we keep database synced across computers? mainly an issue for inventory purposes
